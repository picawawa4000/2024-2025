## NOTICE

This repository contains the public FTC SDK for the CENTERSTAGE (2023-2024) competition season.
Yes, you read that right, the SDK is outdated. And I don't care.

## Welcome!

This repository is a fork of the repository that *officially* contains our code.
I don't like some of the choices that they made regarding programming languages.

## The Goal

To create a proper autonomous operational mode using OpenCV and AprilTags.

Am I using some unorthodox constructions?

Yes. Shamelessly.
